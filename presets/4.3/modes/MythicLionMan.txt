#$ AUTHOR: MythicLionMan
#$ DESCRIPTION: These are my personal modes setup. I put them here for my own use. They really only make sense with my EdgeTX setup.
#$ DESCRIPTION: They have been updated from the old set that I used to use.
#$ DESCRIPTION: Arming is Aux1 (ELRS implements Aux1 as a 1 bit channel for arming safety)
#$ DESCRIPTION: Prearm, AirMode and Turtle mode are multiplexed onto Aux2.
#$ DESCRIPTION: Rateprofiles 0, 1 & 2 can be selected with Aux4
#$ DESCRIPTION: The panic switch will either switch to Angle mode or engage GPS rescue, and always engages the beeper.
#$ DESCRIPTION: The panic functions are Angle mode, GPS Rescue and Beeper and are multiplexed onto Aux3.
#$ DESCRIPTION: Eventually I'd also like to have loiter mode on this channel as an alternative to rescue.
