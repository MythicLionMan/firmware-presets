# This is a synthesis of my OSD settings from old Betaflight CLI dumps. I've merged the values from the
# most recent backups of Inky, Blinky, and Clyde. I suspect that some of the difference are caused by my
# tweaking the positions of some elements on Inky. I suspect further differences are caused by obsolete
# parameters from older versions of Betaflight. Another difference may be caused by sending the CrSf
# LQ using the hack for DJI (which will hopefully not be necessary soon).
# I hope to merge these all into one once I can test it out, but I'm just usign the values from Clyde for now.
