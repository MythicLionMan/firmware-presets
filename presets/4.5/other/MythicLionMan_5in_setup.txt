#$ TITLE: MythicLionMan Setup 5in
#$ FIRMWARE_VERSION: 4.5
#$ CATEGORY: OTHER
#$ STATUS: COMMUNITY
#$ KEYWORDS: personal, GPS
#$ AUTHOR: MythicLionMan
#$ DESCRIPTION: This is my 'standard' quad setup that I have on pretty much all of my rigs. All changes are optional, if nothing is selected nothing will happen.
#$ DESCRIPTION: The setup assumes that the quad will be configured for DSHOT regardless of what is selected.
#$ DESCRIPTION: Don't change any of the settings in the "Passthrough Settings" group. They are meant to configure included scripts.
#$ DESCRIPTION: Failsafe - Stage 2 failsafe is set to Drop. GPS rescue must be enabled via OSD.
#$ DESCRIPTION: Radio Setup - Sets the min_check, max_check and min_throttle values to match the gimbals of my radio.
#$ DESCRIPTION: Radio Protocol - Configures the radio protocol, and optionally LQ emulation for CrSf.
#$ DESCRIPTION: Blackbox Tuning - Increases blackbox_p_ratio for improved resolution tuning when using PIDToolbox
#$ DESCRIPTION: Motor Protocol - Turns on DSHOT600 and sets the motor pwm rate.
#$ DESCRIPTION: GPS - Configures the GPS. Sanity checks are disabled when possible. Arming without a fix is set to true.
#$ WARNING: DSHOT with the ESCs that don't support DSHOT is dangerous and can spin up the motors right away without arming. The ADC filter should be turned off on the radio. For crossfire setups the frequency should be locked to 150Hz. Remember to set the GPS Rescue Hover throttle value accurately.

# I grabbed this setup from my CLI dumps of the backups of Inky, Blinky and Clyde. I've tried to standardize to just the stuff I custom configure on all builds.
